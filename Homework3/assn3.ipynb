    "## Problem 2: Hyperparameter Experimentation with LoRA\n",
    "In your experimentation with the LoRA configuration, document the process and present your findings in a structured manner. Describe the specific LoRA hyperparameters you adjusted, including the rank (`r`) and the learning rate scale (`lora_alpha`). Test a range of values for each and analyze how changing these hyperparameters affects the model's performance in terms of training convergence speed and final model accuracy. Provide graphs or tables to support your findings"
