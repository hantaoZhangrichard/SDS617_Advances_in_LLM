    "a) In this assignment, we will compare BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer). Provide detailed explanations of how the architecture, the type of attention mechanism employed, and the approach to tokenization in each model contribute to their respective capabilities and applications. Which model do you think will perform better at sentiment analysis and why?"

    "- BERT Architecture:\n",
    "BERT only takes the encoder part of the whole encoder-decoder tranformer model. It takes the bidirectioinal attention mechanism such that each token attends to all other tokens in the sentence. The training objective is to predict the masked word in a sentence and classify the true next sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "* BERT tokenization:\n",
    "BERT utilizes the WordPiece algorithm which begins with a base vocabulary of characters and iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords to create new tokens. This approach allows the tokenizer to break down words into smaller pieces, which is particularly useful for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and learning an embedding representation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPT Architecture:\n",
    "GPT takes the decoder part of the whole encoder-decoder tranformer model and it runs autoregressively. GPT uses a causal attention mechanism such that future words are masked during the training and the training objective is to predict the next token\n",
    "\n",
    "* GPT tokenization:\n",
    "GPT utilizes Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which iteratively merges frequent character pairs. This appraoch helps generate coherent text that makes sense in a chat scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis:\n",
    "I think BERT is likely to perform better at sentiment analysis because sentiment analysis requires understanding the entire sentence to interpret meaning. Sentiment analysis can be seen as a classification task so there is no need to generate logical sentence as output. By training on masked word objective and using bidirectional attention mechanism, BERT can learn a good embedding representation that encodes strong semantic understanding. This can better help understanding the entire sentence and interpret the mearning."

Costa! is about 4 girls going to Spain to go on vacation, party, get drunk, get laid (u know the drill). It\\'s also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pro\\'s who\\'re trying to lure the crowd into their club.<br /><br />I\\'m not sure how long it took to write the script, but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you\\'re watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long. Nothing, and i mean nothing is believable in this movie. It\\'s almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline. Suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing. With a one-on-one fight with \\'the bad guy in black\\' and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank-car (can it be more cheesy). Also the words character-development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers.<br /><br />After having seen \"Traffic\" 3 days before this, i fell from sheer brilliance, from a piece of art to this. This is film-making at it\\'s saddest. And don\\'t start about low budget. Because even with a low budget you could write a better script. It almost seems that the film-makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie.<br /><br />Anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit, but for the rest of it, don\\'t waste your money on such garbage.'"
